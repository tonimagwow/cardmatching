# Game Objective
### The objective of Memory Match is to flip two cards at a time. After you flip the two cards if the two colors are identical you've made a match. If the cards do not match they will be flipped over to their original state. You will continue to flip two cards at a time until you find all the matching pairs.

## Conclusion
### I learned a few things about myself when working on this project.
1. I really enjoy working with CSS
... The more and more I work with CSS I notice that I really enjoy working with it because it all seems straight forward.
2. Stick to my original idea
... When I first started working on my project I started with images inside of divs. After running into a few roadblocks, I scrapped my whole project and started from scratch. If I would of worked through the original problems I would of been more satisfied with what I've completed.
3. I need help with Shuffling arrays
... The hardest part of this project for me is getting my cards to shuffle. It's the main function to of the game in order to get the cards to be randomized, in order to have "random" cards on my board I swapped the location of cards in my HTML.
